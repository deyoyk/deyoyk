Hello everyone,

For a while now, I’ve been struggling greatly with my mental health and have been finding it increasingly hard to keep up with the stress. I feel like I am constantly thinking about my life experiences and difficulties and I’ve now gotten to the point where I must put my mental well-being first.

I want to thank all of you that have chosen to believe and support me. Thank all of you who took a chance on me, I very much appreciate those of you who all supported me financially and personally during this time. I am grateful for every single one of you.

I’ve decided to leave coding for good (including Discord bots, website work, Minecraft servers, etc). I’ve deleted my Discord account (loqkey). While I do plan to open source everything I have worked on at some point, I cannot provide a time frame for this.

Thank you to everyone who has been involved in this journey with me.
It truly has been a wonderful experience.

Yours truly,
deyo
